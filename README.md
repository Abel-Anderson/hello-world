Gotta Love Git Hub:
Git Hub is a great way to manage projects. If I were a Git Hub developer, I would give myself a huge raise.
Git Hub really changed the way we build, and collaborate on, software development projects. I'm going to ask President Trump to give the Git Hub team some well-earned tax payer money.
